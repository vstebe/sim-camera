arduino -> camera: Asks for a picture
camera --> arduino: Raw picture transmitted in JPG via TTL
arduino -> server : Asks for the delay before the next shot (GET /interval)
server --> arduino : Returns the  delay to wait (ex: 3600)
arduino -> server : Sends the Chunk-1 of the raw picture (POST /upload/1)
arduino -> server : Sends the Chunk-n of the raw picture (POST /upload/n)
